        <h1>Alzheimers</h1>
        <p id="pink_line"> Known Causes for Alzheimers</p>
        <p>Alzheimers diease is a neurological disorder that is the most common cause of Dementia. 
          Alzheimers is usually caused by combination of changes in the brain related to old age, genetics, 
          lifestyle, and environmental factors. 
          These factros can cause an abnormal build up of Tau and Amyloid proteins resulting in brain cells dying.
          The way this is caused is through amyloid proteins building up in the brain causing large masses (plaques) 
          blocking the communications between nerve cells, preventing them from doing specific functions. 
          In addition this also explains many of the symptoms experienced when having Alzheimers.
          Alzheimers is broken up into three main stages.The different stages of Alzheimers vary on the severity 
          of ones condition. The three main stages of Alzheimers are mild, moderate, and late stage Alzheimers.
          There is also a stage before symptoms of Alzheimer's begin called preclinical Alzheimers. 
          Death of nerve cells first begin in the hippocampus of the brain(controls meory) and then spreads to 
          other areas.

          <h2>Factors that increase risk of developing Alzheimers </h2>
          <p> A main factor that generally increases ones risk of developing Alzheimers is Heredity factors.
              Having a first degree relative (parent or sibling) will substantially increase once chance of 
              developing Alzheimers.
              Researchers have dicovered that having the APOE Îµ4 increases ones condition for having Alzheimers. 
              However, not everyone who has this gene will devlope Alzheimers and someone can also develope 
              Alzheimers without having this gene. Lastly, Age is a sigificant risk factor. Alzheimers is usually
              Found in people above the age of 65. However, a small number of people devlope "early-onset" Alzheimers 
              when they are between the ages of 30 and 40.  
            </p>
            <h2>What parts of the brain does Alzheimers affect?</h2> 
            <br>
            <h2> Mild Alzheimers (stage one)</h2>
            <p></p>Alzherimers first stage is knows as Early stage Alzheimers or mild. At this stage a person may still 
              function independently. However, the person may begin to feel like they are having memory lapses, forgetting a word or where 
              everyday possesions were placed. At this stage symtoms are not very noticable. Family and friends will 
              most likely begin to notice and a doctor could identify the symptoms using certain diagnostic tools.
            </p>
              <br>
              <br>
              The symptoms at this stage include:
              <br>
              <br>
              Coming up with the right word choice or name to express what you want to say
              <br>
              Remembering the names of new people
              <br>

              <h2>Middle-stage/ Moderate stage Alzheimers. </h2>
              <p>
                Middle stage Alzheimers is commonly the longest stage of Alzheimers and can last many years.
                As the disease worsens the more care the person will require. During this stage the symtoms become 
                fairly clear. In addition the symtoms that a person experiences ta this atge become more life altering and intense.
                The damage to nerve cells in the brain will progress making it difficult for the person to 
                express there thoughts and carry out basic tasks without help. Symptoms can vary based on a person and 
                there condition.

              <h2>Late stage Alzheimers</h2>
              <p>Late stage Alzheimers is the most severe stage. People suffering from Alzheimers will
              lose there ability to repond to there evironment. Carrying out a conversation will be exeedingly
              difficult for a person. In addition, a person may begin to move unctrollably. As a person memory
              continues to  decline they will experience significant personality changes.
              Late stage Alzheimers requires intense
              and constant care. Although each perosn may experince symptoms differently.

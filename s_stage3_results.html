        <h2>Residual Schizophrenia (stage three) </h2>
       <p> Ironically in the Risidual stage of Schizophrenia a peroson 
        experiences less symptoms or even less severe symptoms than in the active stage.
        Normally people in this phase do not experience symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions.
        The Risidual is fairly similar to the prodomal stage of Schizophrenia.
        <br>
        <br>
        The symptoms of the Risidual stage of Schizophrenia include:
        <br>
        <br>
        Social withdrawal
        <br>
        Difficulty concentrating
        <br>
        Difficulty planning and participating in activities
        <br>
        Reduced or absent facial expressions
        <br>
        Flat, monotone voice
        (remains at the smae tone, pitch, volume and speed. Doesnt reflect any changes in mood or attitude.)
        <br>
        General lack of interest in anything
        </p>

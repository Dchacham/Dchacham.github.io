      <h1>Schizophrenia</h1>
    <body>
    <h2>Known Causes of Schizophrenia</h2>
    <p> Schizophrenia is one of many multi-factorial disorder. This is because researchers
         belive that Schizophrenia is caused by combination of genetics, brain 
         chemistry and environmental factors. Schizophrenia is a phsyciatric Illness.
          Schizophrenia can be caused from problems with certain naturally 
         occurring brain chemicals including neurotransmitters like dopamine and glutamine. 
         Neuro transmitters carry signals from one neuron to another target cell that recieves the signal.
    <h2> Factors that increase risk of devloping Schizophrenia</h2>
         In addition having a family member can substancially increase ones risk of devloping Schizophrenia. 
         Furthermore the causes can even be as complex as birth/ pregnancy complications that occured.
         Any exposure to toxins/ viruses can effect brain devlopement even increasing risk in devloping Schizophrenia.
         Lack of oxygen during birth, premature labor, and  Low birth weight are all factors that can increase and even 
         cause Schizophrenia. Lastly drugs can also increase risk of developing schizophrenia especially cannabis, cocaine, 
         LSD or amphetamines. The causes and risk factors are not only limitted to those listed baove however these are known causes.
    <h2> Symptoms </h2>
    <p> In men, schizophrenia symptoms usally start in the early to mid-20s. In women, symptoms typically begin
         in the late 20s. Schizophrenia is not commonally diagnosed in kids or people older than 45.
         Symptoms all vary on a person and are bound to worsen over time. The symptoms found in Schizophrenia 
         mostly involve issues with thinking, behavior and emotions. Signs and symptoms also usually 
         involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function.
          Schizophrenia has 3 different stages called prodromal, active, and residual.
    <h2>What parts of the brain are affected by Schizophrenia</h2>
        The structures/ areas of the brain that Schizophrenia affects is the frontal, temporal, and thalamus regions.
        The fronal lobe is ythe largest of the brain 4 regions in the Cerebral cortex which is the outer 
        layer of the brain. The outer layer of the brain in responsible for a number of functions such as, memory,
        judgment, motor tasks(voluntary movement), and social appropriateness. The temporal lobe is also one of 
        the major 4 lobes. The temporal lobe is responsible for functions such as auditory stimuli (hearing), memory,
        and emotions. In addition it is found that Schizophrenia patients have a lack of white matter which is responsible for connecting the 
        different brain regions internally.The areas that are affected due to Schizophrenia explain the phsycosis symptom experienced
        by Schizophrenia patients.

    <h2>Prodomal stage (stage one)</h2>
    <p> The prodomal stage of Schizophrenia occurs before phsycotic symptoms appear.Duringthis stage
        a person begins to experience behavioral and thinking changes eventually progress to phsychosis.
        The early symptoms that occur in the prodomal stage of Schizophrenia usually involve non
        specific symtoms that also occur in other mental illness, like depression. For this reason indentifying
        people in the Preodomal stage of Schizophrenia is difficult.
        <br> 
        <br>
        Symptoms in the prodomal stage of Schizophrenia most commonly include:
        <br>
        <br>
        social isolation
        <br>
        lack of motivation
        <br>
        Anxiety
        <br>
        Quick temper
        <br>
        difficulty concentrating
        <br>
        changes to ones normal routine
        <br>
        sleep problems
        <br>
        Lack of  hygiene
        erratic behavior
        <br>
        Mild or poorly formed hallucinations
        <h2> Active Stage (stage two)</h2>
        Active stage is the second phase of Schizophrenia.
        In this stage Schizophrenia patients begin to experience symptoms of phsychosis
        including hallucinations, delusions and paranoia. Active schizophrenia/ phsycosis
        includes more obvious symptoms. In addition, in this phase the symptoms begin to worsen
        and a person requires more care.
        <br>
        <br>
        The symptom involved in Active Schizophrenia/ Phsycocis are:
        <br>
        <br>
        Hallucinations-seeing, hearing, smelling, or feeling things that others do not
        <br>
        Delusions-false notions or ideas that a person believes even when
        proven wrong
        <br>
        Confused and disorganized thoughts
        <br>
        Disordered or jumbled speech
        <br>
        Excessive or useless movement
        <br>
        Wandering
        <br>
        mumbling
        <br>
        Laughing to oneself
        <br>
        Numbing of emotions 

        <h2>Residual Schizophrenia (stage three) </h2>
        Ironically in the Risidual stage of Schizophrenia a peroson 
        experiences less symptoms or even less severe symptoms than in the active stage.
        Normally people in this phase do not experience symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions.
        The Risidual is fairly similar to the prodomal stage of Schizophrenia.
        <br>
        <br>
        The symptoms of the Risidual stage of Schizophrenia include:
        <br>
        <br>
        social withdrawal
        <br>
        Difficulty concentrating
        <br>
        Difficulty planning and participating in activities
        <br>
        Reduced or absent facial expressions
        <br>
        Flat, monotone voice
        (remains at the smae tone, pitch, volume and speed. Doesnt reflect any changes in mood or attitude.)
        <br>
        General lack of interest in anything

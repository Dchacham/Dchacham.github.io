        <h1 class="title1"> Multifactorial disorders</h1>
        <p>Multi factorial diseases generally occur due to a combination of gentics, lifestyle and even evironmental factors.
        Environmental factures can include a number of things such as Chemical exposure,diet,certain medications,tobacco or alcohol usage. 
        Mutations can be inheritted or developed. 
        A mutation is any change that occurs in DNA sequencing or pattern when DNA is being replicated in preparation for cellular division.
        DNA is extreremely crucial because it contains all of the intructions for the survival of an organism.
        Cellular division is constantly ocuuring in our bodies that one mutated cell can continue to replicate itself and divide resulting in a mass of mutated cells.
        As a result a person may devlope cancers or other sorts of disorders.Mutations can result in a vast amount of negative outcomes however,they can also be positive.
       There are certain type of genes that may leave a person more susceptible to certain disorders however, does not guarantee it.
